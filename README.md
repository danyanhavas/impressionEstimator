# impressionEstimator

Hi! You were probably directed here because you need to estimate the amount of impressions you need to run your A/B or MVT test.

Good news! You can do this in 3 simple steps. Feel free to ignore the steps if you're familiar with R:

<ul>
<li> Download impressionEstimator.R by right-clicking on the [link to the file](https://github.com/danyanhavas/impressionEstimator/blob/master/impressionEstimator.R) and clicking Save Link As or equivalent
<li> Open R/RStudio 
<li> If you're on Windows, move the impressionEstimator.R file to C:\Users\Public
<li> Execute the code below in R
</ul>

If you're on a Mac, copy the following commands into R:
      
      setwd("~/Downloads")
      source("impressionEstimator.R")
      
      
If you're on Windows, copy the following commands into R:

      setwd("C:/Users/Public")
      source("impressionEstimator.R")
